## 2022-03-16 Hardware Change

Originally, this project relied on the following hardware components:

- [ItsyBitsy M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800)
- [Adafruit AirLift](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4201)
- [2.9" E-ink Monochrome display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4262)

(estimated cost: ~$50)

While these were a pleasure to work with but were more expensive than
the bare-bones requirements needed for this project.
